# NRL (National Rugby League)-Java

NRL is a Rugby League competition played by professional players in sixteen teams from three states of Australia and Newland.

This programming project was to create an object-oriented menu-driven java program that is able to generate the competition ladder for any chosen rounds.

# Main Menu Item Functionality
  
# 1. Display Match Schedule
  When this menu option is selected the program should determine from the user if they want to view the schedule for all rounds of the competition or just a selected round.
